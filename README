The script can help to detect compromised mirrors for some hacking scenarios,
but it doesn't guaranty a total security for more complex, though improbable, ones.

It's recommended to use 3 or 4 different mirrors from diverse locations,
and at least one for the full compare option.

Since the release of pacman 4 which implements package gpg signing, no further 
development will be made to this script.
